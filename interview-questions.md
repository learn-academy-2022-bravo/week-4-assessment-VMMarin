# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:Props ( properties) act as arguments, and allow data to be passed between components

  Researched answer: Props stands for properties. In React, properties act as arguments do in JS. They allow us to pass data between components.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: I will research the answer to this question.

  Researched answer:  DOM events are used in conjunction with functions. They allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.

*note I'm understanding these as something similar to built-in methods for user interaction



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming utilizes objects to organize data. Functional programming utilizes variables and functions.

  Researched answer: Functional programming is declarative - Functional programming utilizes variables and functions. Functions do not modify variables, but instead output new variables.  Object-oriented programming is imperative and utilizes objects to organize data.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:  A float is a number that contains a decimal. An integer is a whole number (no decimal)

  Researched answer: Both float and integer are numerical data types. The key differences are float numbers are those with a decimal point, while integers are numbers without decimals.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby automatically returns the value of the last line of a code block

  Researched answer: The implicit return in Ruby means a return is not needed, as Ruby automatically returns the value of the last line of a code block
